#Unity-X
Unity X aims to be a community-owned organisation that develops robust and reusable unity packages. Contributions on any repository are most welcome.
##Pillars
* Nobody owns Unity-X
* Everybody is welcome to submit pull requests
* The packages should be robust and generic enough to be reused by many
